## Background
The Blockchain group is the newly formed Special Interest Group of the UMass ACM. The UMass ACM has an umbrella structure wherein it has 6 SIGs (Special Interest Groups) operating under the
general body. Each SIG has its own members, leadership and structure. 

As the General Body of the ACM, we allow space and flexibility to each SIG so that they can operate in a way that is best suited for their particular structure. Even in that, however, we ensure
that no SIG struggles or starts dying because of lack of proactiveness. This is ensured through regular reports sent to the ACM at 60 day intervals and one on one meetings between the SIG and
ACM Leadership to discuss their problems/progress.

The ACM provides all its SIGs with any support they require: *financial, logistical, marketing*.
