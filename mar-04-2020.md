# Meetings notes

## Tomorrow's meeting
We are planning on ordering 6-7 pizzas from a pizza place tomorrow, delivered around 545 to the BCE.
We need to specifically ask for plates.

## Poster
We definitely need to make various designs for posters and other marketing materials but we're not going to do that today.

For the rest of the meeting we created a presentation for the general interest meeting.
